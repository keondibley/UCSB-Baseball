# UCSB-Baseball

This repository showcases a project examining catcher framing data for UCSB's Baseball Team, as well as other teams in the Big West Conference. The RShiny application takes individual pitch data as input. It creates a map of where strikes and balls are caught by different catchers, in addition to a table that creates metrics for each catcher's framing proficiency. The zipped file contains the large dataset; a smaller one is also available in the repository for use.
