# UCSB-Baseball

This repository showcases a project examining catcher framing data for UCSB's Baseball Team as well as other teams in the Big West Conference. The application takes individual pitch data as input, and creates a map of where strikes and balls are caught by different catchers, in addition to a table that creates metrics for each catcher's framing proficiency. The zipped file contains the large dataset, there is a smaller one in the repo that can be used as well. 

Here is a link to the published application: [text](https://keydibs.shinyapps.io/framing_ucsb/)
